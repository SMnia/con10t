<p>Based on their tradition in research, the <a href=
"http://www.dainst.org/en/projekt/-/project-display/81139?" target=
"_blank">DAI</a> holds the largest and oldest stocks of images worldwide within
the field of archaeology of the Mediterranean countries. These images are
digitized and made accessible in a long-term plan, by the database Arachne,
which is run by the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) and the <a href=
"http://archaeologie.uni-koeln.de/node/23" target="_blank">CoDArchLab</a>.
Especially the oldest and historical most invaluable images are threatened by
physical decomposition and destruction because of environmental influences,
natural catastrophes like earthquakes and in the long run, manual use. Today's
scientists have to research collections of each DAI's photo archive in person,
which leads to gradual wear marks on the original material even upon careful
handling. By that, even in the best case, the basic material is charged.
Besides these problems of conservation, the deficit of development is obvious
within the information, which is included in the negative holdings. The
structuring schemes of the photo libraries cannot replace a structured subject
indexing. The potential of the glass negatives, belonging to the DAI has to
regarded, not only as threatened, but also as lying fallow.</p>

<p>The project started in 2006 by editing the glass negatives from the
departments of the German Archaeological Institute in Athens, Istanbul and
Cairo (Emagines1). In 2008 a second project phase continued the work, by
dealing with the negatives from Rome, Madrid, the headquarters in Berlin and
the Eurasia-Department (Emagines2). The subject of the third phase of this
project, which is funded by the DFG, is 40,000 more glass negatives, which are
threatened immediately by physical degradation. These negatives are situated in
the departments of the German Archaeological Institute in Athens, Berlin and
Rome. Besides the pure digitization and development of these negatives, the
project aims the improve of integration in the semantic web by extending the
CRM- implementation in Arachne and the integration in other web resources like
Perseus, CLAROS and Prometheus. The installation of an open-access-area for all
of the 120,000 scans within the project and the implementation of the
Creative-Commons-License are new aims of the third project phase. By the
programming of a module for image and object identification (URN), every image
shall come to be clear and permanent citable. Furthermore a multilingual
user-surface shall be created.</p>
<p>The negatives mostly contain historical images of sculpture, topography and
architecture, much of which no longer exists in its former condition. The
holding is qualitative and quantitative a unique stock, even international
compared to the Mediterranean countries. The aim is a permanent digital
conservation of the information of the glass negatives and the database related
development on the internet via Arachne. To avoid exposing the fragile contents
from the risks of long-distance transport, the images are being scanned in the
departments of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) in an on-going
process. The scanned images are then sent to the CoDArchLab for digital
processing, entry into a database and long-term storage on the SAN of the
University of Cologne for the DAI. The resulting documentation-complex is a
centralised scientific of the DAI which can be accessed by web.</p>
<p>About 92,000 (week 32 in 2010) glass negatives are currently available in
Arachne. About 53,000 of these belong to the Emagines2 project. A fuzzy meta
search for 'D-DAI-ATH', 'D-DAI-IST', 'D-DAI-ROM', 'D-DAI-EUR', 'D-DAI-Z',
'D-DAI-MAD' and 'D-DAI-KAI' leads to an overview of about 44,000 object records
of different categories, to which the glass negatives are referred. The glass
negatives can be referenced through 92,000 records using
image-navigation.</p><img src="./emagines_img/DFG_zweizeilig_blau_1.jpg" align=
