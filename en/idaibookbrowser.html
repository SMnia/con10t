  <p>The iDAI.bookbrowser integrates documents in the object structure of
  Arachne, providing direct links between “real world” objects and their
  textual descriptions. It also helps to overcome the isolated presentation of
  books and contextualises them against the background of their cultural
  environments.</p>

  <p>The iDAI.bookbrowser's most important components are digitized prints from
  the 16th to 19th centuries, currently about 2000. Every title is
  biographically referenced in the ZENON DAI and linked to its record in the
  iDAI.bookbrowser. These books belong to the holdings of the Rome Department
  of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI), the Cologne Digital Archeology
  Laboratory (CoDArchLab) at the Archaeological Institute of the University of
  Cologne, the Cologne University Library and to the Winckelmann-Institute at
  Stendal.</p>

  <p>As another component thematically coherent convolutes are edited and
  contextualised. These include the photo album of baron Max von Oppenheim, a
  very valuable document for regional studies, or the handwritten inventory of
  the photograph collection of the Rome Department of the German Archaeological
  Institute.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the iDAI.Bookbrowser is linked with external web portals
  like the virtual library Propylaeum specialized in classical and ancient
  studies as well as the Central Register of Digitised Prints (zvdd). Thus, its
  contents cannot be retrieved only directly via Arachne and ZENON but can be
  also found and retrieved through different other web portals. In this way the
  iDAI.Bookbrowser's web presence is growing progressively.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the iDAI.Bookbrowser supports the Metadata Encoding and
  Transmission Standard (METS) due to its OAI-interface. Its programming takes
  place at the Cologne Digital Archeology Laboratory. The Berlin head office of
  the German Archeological Institute as well as the Faculty of Arts and
  Humanities of the University of Cologne provide financing for this
  project.</p>
