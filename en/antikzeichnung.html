  target="_blank">the German Archaeological Institute in Rome</a> preserves,
  among others, two collections of manual drawings: "The Historical Archive"
  consisting of drawings mainly going back to the foundation of the Institute
  in 1829 until the first decades of the 20th century. The other collection,
  "The Architectural Archive", initiated with the reopening of the Institute in
  1953, contains large-scale graphical documentation created during
  archaeological fieldwork. These drawings show a wide range of monuments such
  as architectural structures, panoramas, layouts and reconstructive plans in
  addition to sheets showing topographical maps and a variety of finds within
  different categories.</p>

  <p>The unique drawings, paintings, plans, sections and sketches of both
  collections depict ancient monuments and objects, many of which are lost,
  destroyed, damaged or altered nowadays, for instance due to restoration or
  environmental impact. Hence, these drawings have not only an artistic value,
  but rather constitute a very important testimony of the illustrated
  individual objects and monuments. At the same time these collections
  represent a part of the history of the archaeological research.</p>

  <p>Within this project, the complete "Historical Archive" and selected parts
  of the "Architectural Archive" will be digitized and catalogued appropriately
  in order to provide a permanent worldwide online access. Via <a href=
  "http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/drupal/?ft" target="_blank">Arachne</a> and
  <a href="http://opac.dainst.org/F?" target="_blank">ZENON-DAI</a> the
  digitized material will be scientifically contextualized and virtually
  available on a sustained basis and free of charge. The integration of
  bibliographical meta data, registered for each sheet individually in
  ZENON-DAI, is carried out via an interface in Arachne where the drawings are
  visualized within the <a href="http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/drupal/node/98"
  target="_blank&quot;">iDAI.bookbrowser</a> as well as the <a href=
  "http://dfg-viewer.de/ueber-das-projekt/" target=
  "_blank&quot;">DFG-viewer</a>.</p>

  <p>The technological processing allows a virtual browsing experience that
  simulates the - until now - locally restricted physical insight, supplemented
  by additional information. The aggregated digital data will be connected to
  the EU initiatives <a href="http://carare.eu" target="_blank">CARARE</a> and
  <a href="http://europeana.eu" target="_blank">Europeana</a> and accessible
  worldwide via the <a href="http://www.clarosnet.org/XDB/ASP/clarosHome/"
  target="_blank">CLAROS</a> network.</p>
