  <p>The complete catalog of sculptures in the Antikensammlung der Staatlichen
  Museen zu Berlin (Antiquities Collection of the Berlin State Museums)
  contains approximately 2,600 Greek, Cypriot, Etruscan, and Roman sculptures
  in stone, as well as several large bronzes (including both extant objects and
  those now lost). The catalog is based on a full-scale reexamination of these
  objects conducted by Das Berliner Skulpturennetzwerk (“The Berlin Sculpture
  Network”) in 2009-2012. Already in 2011, the bronzes in the Antiquities
  Collection (8,277 individual objects, including those lost in the war) were
  made publicly available in the online database <a href=
  "http://www.smb.museum/antikebronzenberlin/" target="_blank">Antike Bronzen
  in Berlin</a>.</p>

  <p>Some 2,600 objects from the Berlin Antiquities Collection have been newly
  photographed from multiple viewpoints and supplemented with historical
  photographs and documentation of restoration. Numerous sculptures stood
  before the camera lens for the very first time. In addition, over one hundred
  researchers contributed new, detailed texts. Special attention was devoted to
  investigating context, which led to many new discoveries through intensive
  archival research; this also enabled a thorough examination of the
  sculptures’ original display contexts and post-antique reception. The
  sculpture from Pergamon and Magnesia on the Meander underwent special
  scrutiny, as their excavation documentation was systematically
  inspected.</p><img src="../arachne/images/logo_leiste_berlin.jpg">
