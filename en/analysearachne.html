    <p>A basic requirement is a solid pool in terms of a well used and
    contextualized research database.</p>
    <p>The <a con10t-page="anstieg">increase of the average attendance per
    week</a>, from 500 visitors in 2008 to 1500 visitors, which was observed
    after the conversion to Arachne 3.0 since the beginning of 2009, has
    <a con10t-page="arachneusage2010">successfully continued in 2010</a>.
    Therefore Arachne offers the ideal conditions for the research processes
    listed in the following:</p>
    <p>By searching for one or more terms, most of the n <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval" target=
    "_blank">IR-systems</a> applied today offer users an aligned amount of
    search results.</p>
    <p>Contextualized object databases, like Arachne for example, allow the
    user to navigate from one object, which he has chosen from the original
    search result, to other objects, which are linked to it (i. e.
    contextualized). This browsing or navigating within contexts forms an
    integral part of research processes and can lead to the user finding
    objects displayed that no longer even contain the originally requested
    search terms and therefore were not included in the actual search
    results.</p>
    <p>Even though the objects do not contain the used search terms, one can
    still expect them to have at least some relation to each other. A detailed
    record may also permit conclusions as to the extent of analogy between the
    search terms and the displayed objects. The cohesion between these factors
    is to be surveyed with the help of a detailed record of research processes,
    by using the example of the Arachne-database.</p>
    <h2>Studies that have been conducted so far:</h2>
    <p>In order to estimate whether research processes in contextualized
    object-databases have enough depth for this research project, each userâ€™s
    movements in Arachne were anonymized and recorded for a limited amount of
    time during a first test run.</p>
    <p>The results showed, among other things, that during the time the test
    was conducted, in more than 25% of the sessions more than 10 datasets were
    viewed. This and further studies have proven that the research processes in
    fact provide enough depth for the aspired research project. The present
    results were displayed to an international audience of specialists on the
    <a href="http://www.caa2009.org/">CCAA2009</a>in Williamsburg in April
    2009.</p>
