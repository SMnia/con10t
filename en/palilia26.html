  <p>In 1873 August Mau published his ground-breaking discovery that the wall
  paintings in the houses of Pompeii do not date back to the town's last twenty
  or thirty years, before it was buried by the Vesuvian ashes in 79 A.D., but
  to a period of more than two hundred years, documenting domestic culture
  during the transition from Late Hellenistic to Imperial Times. Consequently,
  the contexts of decoration were stylistically distinguished. However, the
  motivation to maintain the older decoration, parts of which were almost two
  hundred years old, rather than replacing them with modern painting, has not
  been questioned so far.</p>

  <p>This gap is closed in the presented work by examining the murals'
  micro-historical context. Gradually, a rational strategy becomes apparent in
  the way the ancient house owners would have entire rooms or just certain
  walls redecorated following recent painting trends, at the same time
  preserving and restoring already existing, older decorations and/or merging
  them with contemporary elements to a seemingly harmonious, amalgamated
  whole.</p>

  <p>As usual the volume includes a detailed catalogue section. All collected
  material which have been the argumentative basis for the assessment of the
  respective context of decoration within a house are compiled here. This
  section would not only exceed the financial conditions of a printed
  publication, but also fragmentary in the long term considering the flood of
  new publication on Campanian antique sites. Therefore, this section will be
  available as an online-Catalogue within the Arachne. The material is
  organized by its location and further by house numbers or rather by the
  modern building name. Information about the decoration of every individual
  room can be found in the corresponding linked records.</p>
