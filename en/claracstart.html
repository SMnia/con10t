  <p><strong>Prof. Dr. Dietrich Boschung</strong></p>

  <p>The realization of the project would not have been possible had the
  Fritz-Thyssen-Foundation not so generously funded it. The goal was to
  coherently portray the state of archaeological knowledge on ancient statues
  in around 1850. This is enabled by Clarac’s “Musée de sculpture antique et
  moderne”, which contains six volumes. By combining it with the results of
  research conducted so far as well as the documentation, the relation between
  media of documentation and scientific questions is to become clear. Therefore
  work has concentrated on the volumes III – V. Thus, the about 3.000 Greek and
  Roman statues illustrated by Clarac have been recorded. As the current
  location could be determined for the major part of the statues, it was
  possible to link them to up-to-date catalogues and databases.</p>

  <p>Since Clarac refers to publications as old as from the 16th century for
  his illustrations as well as for his explanations, the work also contains a
  description of the state of archaeological knowledge before the develpoment
  of photography, which then enabled new forms of capture, of comparison and
  also of categorization. A brief text, complementary to the database,
  describes the history of origins, the intention, the historical position as
  well as the effect of Clarac’s work.</p>

  <p>The information-technological realization of the project consists of the
  following interlocking processes:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>the digitalization of the volumes of "Musée de sculpture antique et
    moderne"</li>

    <li>the scientific development of the sculptures illustrated by Clarac</li>

    <li>the research and media-historical synthesis of the work</li>

    <li>the expansion of Arachne with a reception module</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Volumes 3-6 are now available online in Arachne.</p>

  <p>The scientific analysis concentrated on central areas in Clarac’s work,
  such as the sculptures in the Louvre as well as the European collections he
  analyzed. Results of the process were:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>around 2300 reception records</li>

    <li>around 2200 reproduction records</li>

    <li>around 300 individual object reference records</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The creation of records naturally involved linking them to individual
  objects, reproductions, receptions, sometimes to multipart monuments and of
  course to their respective historic collections. Furthermore, the older
  engravings used by Clarac have been digitized in the bookbrowser
  (<a con10t-page="idaibookbrowser" target="_blank">to
  iDAI.bookbrowser</a>).</p>

  <p>The expansion of Arachne with a reception module offers the possibility to
  differentiate between historical statements on an object and factual
  information about the same object. This structure was projected on the
  concept of an online book with flippable pages.</p>
