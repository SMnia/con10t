  <p>Palilia volume 20 is about the military in the city of Rome in all its
  aspects, especially the multiple layers of its cultural image, its effect on
  the urban population, and its significance for civilian life in the capital.
  In the Republican period Rome was considered a "demilitarised" zone. Under
  Augustus soldiers were stationed in the imperial capital for the first time,
  marking a decisive turning point between Republic and Principate. Between
  10,000 and 40,000 soldiers lived and worked in Imperial Rome and constituted
  an important part of the civic culture of the city.</p>

  <p>This book is the first comprehensive evaluation of the written,
  archaeological and iconographic sources for the military in Rome and the life
  and function of the Roman soldier in the capital.</p>

  <p>The basis of archeological material for the study, like the architectural
  remains of the troops' accommodations <a con10t-search-catalog=
  "katbaubef">(to the catalogue)</a> as well as the grave monuments of soldiers
  and veterans <a con10t-search-catalog="katgrabdenk">(to the catalogue)</a>,
  was recorded and structured using the Arachne-database. Here, in addition to
  the printed work, all of the archaeological material can be recorded, found
  and according to the user's criteria it can be also re-sorted and exported by
  using both the catalogue's index of contents and via the ›Metasearch‹ as well
  as the ›Advanced Search‹. Arachne as a dynamic platform offers also the
  author the opportunity to add information to known pieces but also to missing
  pieces that became known after the publication of the book. The author is
  grateful for information, additions and corrections.</p>
