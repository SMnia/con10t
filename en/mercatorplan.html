  <p>The funding by the Archaeological Society Cologne, permitted the
  digitalization and contextualization of Mercator's Map of Cologne as one
  aspect of the project “Antiquitates Coloniae” under the leadership of Prof.
  Dr. Dietrich Boschung. From these resources, the programming of a browser –
  basing on datasets related to objects and the collections' background of the
  antiques in the data base of Arachne – for centralizing and visualizing them
  has been financed. The depictions of antiques framing the map are defined as
  clickable “hotspots” leading to the real objects' appropriate datasets and
  their background information.</p>

  <p>Mercator’s Map of the city of Cologne - realized in 1571 – firstly offered
  a possibility to gain an insight into the cityscape of 16th century Cologne
  and to localize the depicted buildings using georeferencing. The pictured
  objects - mostly antique – and the associated catalogue-like annotations made
  by Mercator let the map serve as a very important source to assign the still
  existing antiques to their contexts of provenience and collections on one
  hand, on the other hand to study the lost objects in detail.</p>

  <p>Both the still existing and the missing antiques have been classified in
  datasets whose contents base on the researches by comparative analysis of P.
  Noelke, H. Gregarek, B. und. H. Galsterer (inscriptions) und J. Klinkenberg.
  Referring to the history of the particular collections, I. Kirgus provided an
  informative basis.</p>

  <p>To gain information about the lost objects as well as to detect potential
  mistakes in Mercator's engravings, the next step provided to consult a
  further contemporary reference. It is Stephan Broelman's “Epideigma” (1608).
  Many objects are congruent with those Mercator depicted, some are different.
  All of them are presented in a museum-like atmosphere. The corresponding
  antiques have been compared with each other and – as far as possible – with
  the real objects as well for gaining information of the contemporary
  perspective on antiques, but primarily to get a precise idea of the lost
  objects' appearances.</p>

  <p>The results of the comparison are shown in new datasets concerning
  Broelman's reproductions and linked to Mercator's equivalences.</p>

  <p>The project included the design and development of the Mercator Browser
  that allows a faster access to the datasets and their linkings, offers
  introducing information about the item by clicking and provides a better
  visualization of the reproductions' collectivity.</p>
