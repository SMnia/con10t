  <h1>Arachne-Usage 2013 and the years before</h1>

  <p>In the last years the Arachne Database constantly attracted more and more
  Users. In our attempts to use Google Analytics according to the rules of
  German Data Protection Laws we started to analyse Arachne usage in 2011. For
  the year 2011 we noticed a <a con10t-page="arachneusage2011" target=
  "_blank">80% Increase in usage of Arachne.</a></p>

  <p>One of the reasons for that was seen in the introduction of an English
  user Interface. In consequence the Arachne Database is better accessible to
  non German speaking visitors.</p>

  <h2>Visitors (Long-time Retrospective)</h2>

  <p>The year 2013 has left the Arachne Database with a plus of about 26%
  percent of Page Visits(256.010) and Unique visitors(131.300). In Comparison
  of to the year 2012 the total page visits increased by 56.000 and the Unique
  Visitors increased by ca. 29.000 . In comparison to the year 2011 to 2012 the
  percentage increase of Visits and Unique visitors where higher but the
  increase in total numbers stayed the same, an increase of about 50.000 visits
  a year.</p>

  <h2>International Visitors</h2>

  <p>In the year 2013 the biggest increase of visits was in Germany where a
  plus of ca. 24.000 (22,77%) visitors where recorded. Visits from other
  European country increased by up to 65,26% in Italy. Other country’s within
  the Europe notices a high increase of Visitors for example France(42,23%),
  UK(42,43%) , Spain(51,89%), Greece(51,98%) .</p>

  <p>This increase of international visitors seems to be a long term effect of
  the Internationalisation and Translation of the Interface.</p>

  <h2>General traffic sources</h2>

  <p>The most visitors are Visitors are referred to arachne by Search Engines
  like Google or Bing(over 140.000). The second biggest group of visitors are
  direct visitors (58.952). This means they open arachne from a their bookmarks
  or by Typing in the URL of Arachne. The second group of direct visitors seems
  faster growing than the visitors directed by search engines.</p>

  <h2>Academic traffic</h2>

  <p>The traffic of interlinking between digital resources and the expert
  community itself seems to be a new factor in the Arachne-visits. The
  <em>Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum</em> <a href="http://cil.bbaw.de/" target=
  "_blank">(<cite>CIL</cite>)</a> made it from the start to rank three (9.670
  Visits) of the pages directing visitors to Arachne. This is slightly more
  than the visitors coming from Wikipedia (8.065 from german Wikipedia and 1022
  from the english Wikipedia ). With an <em>average visit duration</em>
  (<cite>avd</cite>) of 6:15 minutes and 6.60 <em>average page per Visits</em>
  (<cite>ppv</cite>) the average visitor from (<cite>CIL</cite>) stays much
  longer than the average user from Wikipedia about 2:35 an approximately 4
  Page Visits.</p>

  <p>The general audience coming from Google and entering directly staying
  longer and visiting more sites in average.</p>

  <p>People coming from sites like the University of Leipzig(<cite>avd</cite>:
  10:31 <cite>ppv</cite>: 16.64), the German Archaeological Institute (DAI)
  (<cite>avd</cite>:8:30, <cite>apv</cite>:14.23), University of Heidelberg
  (<cite>avd</cite>:14:36, <cite>apv</cite>:22.99) stay even longer. Also all
  University visitors have a high revisiting rate. This means that there is a
  lot of people coming back again and again. In General the bouncing rate,
  people that go somewhere else after arriving on the first page, from academic
  sources 14-45% is much lower than that of the general visitors from Google
  and other non academic sources (49-69%). The “low” ratings for the
  (<cite>CIL</cite>) in comparison with the other Academic sources like the DAI
  and the University’s can be explained by looking at the structure of the
  inter-linkage between the (<cite>CIL</cite>) and Arachne. The
  (<cite>CIL</cite>)links directly to the datasets. Therefor the scanned
  (<cite>CIL</cite>) volumes of interest can be browsed and downloaded but the
  navigation can be continued back at the (<cite>CIL</cite>) page.</p>

  <p>Even if the “Academic traffic” just makes a little percentage of visitors
  of Arachne database it has a different Quality. People coming from other
  academic institutions revisit more often an stay longer. This is also an
  achievement of the inter-linkage of scientific Institutions. The more precise
  links are, the higher seems the acceptance of the site Database (low drop-out
  rate as in the (<cite>CIL</cite>)). But the more precise links are the more
  precise seems the Interest in the dataset and the visiting time stays short.
  The user finds what he wants. The user does not stay as long as if they are
  coming from a more general link from other academic sources (relatively short
  visiting time from (<cite>CIL</cite>)).</p>

  <p>Another point of interest is the change of entry behavior. At first people
  note the Website by links and then bookmark the Database and become members
  of the direct visitors group.</p>

  <p>This report is not an exhaustive analysis in the usage of Arachne. It
  tries to give an overview of the indicators that can be seen in the Google
  Analytics data. Further research has to be conducted on how interlinkage and
  the granularity of links influences the flow of academic users and the usage
  of Linked academic sources.</p>
