            <p>The Museum of Antiquities of the Leipzig University, which was founded
                in 1840, is an archaeological teaching collection that contains plaster
                casts and originals of ancient art from the Mediterranean area. As academic
                collections usually do, it consists of an extensive assortment of ancient
                minor arts objects aiming to give a representative and systematic cross
                section of ancient art. The collection mainly contains Greek and Etruscan
                vases, terracottas, statuettes and bronze objects as well as other minor
                artworks. Large sized sculpture is available to teaching and science mainly
                in form of plaster-casts of important works of statuary and architectural
                sculpture. Originals are only represented by a few portrait heads and some
                fragments of statues and attic grave reliefs.</p>
            <p>In the past few years, along with the publication of the collection’s
                holdings, a project has been initiated in close cooperation with the
                CoDArchLab of the Cologne University to set up an image-database. In the
                course of a photo campaign the CoDArchLab documented the exhibited and
                archived monuments of ancient sculpture and made them available to the
                public via Arachne, some of these for the first time. After this the
                integration of the approximately 700 reproductions of ancient sculptures,
                that were preserved after World War II or newly acquired since the
                reconstruction of the plaster-cast collection in 1999, began.</p>
            <p>The next step is to record and gradually transfer the original
                collection focus of the Museum of Antiquities, which evolved in a
                historical process in the 19th and early 20th century, into Arachne: the
                so-called minor arts. The digital capture and photographic documentation
                serve as a basis for the further analysis and processing of the objects
                from the Leipzig collection. Their integration into Arachne as a central
                object-database of classical studies is to make them available to
                archaeologists and students for free worldwide online research.</p>
