        <p>The Greek author Pausanias, who was active in the 2nd century CE in the
            intellectual atmosphere of the Second Sophistic, wrote his “Description
            of Greece” (perihegesis tes Hellados) with the aim of dealing with “all
            Greek things” (panta ta Hellenika). Under this classicist premise, he mentioned
            and described many things worth seeing (theoremata), not least being works
            of art, together with oral and literary narratives (logoi) associated with
            them which were collected by Pausanias in the cities and sanctuaries of
            Greece during the Roman era.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the database “Images in Pausanias” is to register systematically
            all figurative works of art found in Pausanias and make them accessible
            for combined online research. Bibliographical notes are provided in order
            to facilitate access to the respective scholarship. Regarding bibliography,
            Book X is still a work in progress, due to the fact that the volume in
            question of the commented edition “Pausania, Guida della Grecia” has not
            yet appeared (August 2014), the latter being an important source for the
            database.</p>
        <p>For original Greek works of art that have survived and have been plausibly
            identified, links are given to the meta-database “Arachne” (in progress).
            Roman works of art, which are considered by modern scholarship to be copies
            of Greek originals mentioned in Pausanias, have not been taken into consideration
            because of the hypothetical nature of the majority of these attributions
            and without a clear borderline between plausible and improbable identifications
            being present.</p>
        <p>The content of the database for every work of art provides the text passage
            of Pausanias in question, together with a German translation of the text
            (E. Meyer, in some cases modified). Moreover, it contains information in
            the following categories: place and context of original setting (e.g. sanctuary,
            public space), function (e.g. cult statue, commemorative monument, honorary
            statue), genre (e.g. sculpture in the round, relief), theme, artist, commissioner,
            material, and date. A combined search is possible via the extended search
            function of “Arachne".</p>
        <p>This project was realized under the direction of Tonio Hölscher at the
            Institute of Classical Archaeology of the University of Heidelberg. The
            task of compiling and processing the data was in the hands of Katharina
            Bolle, Gunnar Dumke, Johannes Fouquet, Werner Schneider and Nicolas Zenzen.
            All work in Heidelberg was financed by the Institute of Classical Archaeology
            and from funds of the Manfred Lautenschläger Research prize awarded to
            Tonio Hölscher.</p>
        <p>The implementation of the database “Images in Pausanias” into the meta-database
            “Arachne” was initiated and supervised by Reinhard Förtsch. The data import
            was prepared and coordinated by Marcel Riedel. Benjamin Gelhaar and David
            Neugebauer executed the implementation. The present page was developed
            by Karen Schwane. To all sponsors and promoters as well as to all collaborators
            and contributors we express our warmest thanks.</p>
