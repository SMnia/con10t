  <p>The Greek author Pausanias, who was active in the 2nd century CE in the
  intellectual atmosphere of the Second Sophistic, wrote his “Description of
  Greece” (perihegesis tes Hellados) with the aim of dealing with “all Greek
  things” (panta ta Hellenika). Under this classicist premise, he mentioned and
  described many things worth seeing (theoremata), not least being works of
  art, together with oral and literary narratives (logoi) associated with them
  which were collected by Pausanias in the cities and sanctuaries of Greece
  during the Roman era.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the database “Images in Pausanias” is to register
  systematically all figurative works of art found in Pausanias and make them
  accessible for combined online research. Bibliographical notes are provided
  in order to facilitate access to the respective scholarship. Regarding
  bibliography, Book X is still a work in progress, due to the fact that the
  volume in question of the commented edition “Pausania, Guida della Grecia”
  has not yet appeared (August 2014), the latter being an important source for
  the database.</p>

  <p>For original Greek works of art that have survived and have been plausibly
  identified, links are given to the meta-database “Arachne” (in progress).
  Roman works of art, which are considered by modern scholarship to be copies
  of Greek originals mentioned in Pausanias, have not been taken into
  consideration because of the hypothetical nature of the majority of these
  attributions and without a clear borderline between plausible and improbable
  identifications being present.</p>

  <p>The content of the database for every work of art provides the text
  passage of Pausanias in question, together with a German translation of the
  text (E. Meyer, in some cases modified). Moreover, it contains information in
  the following categories: place and context of original setting (e.g.
  sanctuary, public space), function (e.g. cult statue, commemorative monument,
  honorary statue), genre (e.g. sculpture in the round, relief), theme, artist,
  commissioner, material, and date. A combined search is possible via the
  extended search function of “Arachne".</p>

  <p>This project was realized under the direction of Tonio Hölscher at the
  Institute of Classical Archaeology of the University of Heidelberg. The task
  of compiling and processing the data was in the hands of Katharina Bolle,
  Gunnar Dumke, Johannes Fouquet, Werner Schneider and Nicolas Zenzen. All work
  in Heidelberg was financed by the Institute of Classical Archaeology and from
  funds of the Manfred Lautenschläger Research prize awarded to Tonio
  Hölscher.</p>

  <p>The implementation of the database “Images in Pausanias” into the
  meta-database “Arachne” was initiated and supervised by Reinhard Förtsch. The
  data import was prepared and coordinated by Marcel Riedel. Benjamin Gelhaar
  and David Neugebauer executed the implementation. The present page was
  developed by Karen Schwane. To all sponsors and promoters as well as to all
  collaborators and contributors we express our warmest thanks.</p>
