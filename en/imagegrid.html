  <p>The agglomeration of data in Arachne over the last three years led to the
  insight that the manual labour of creating metadata for every image seemed
  impractical. Between 2002 and 2007 the number of images stored in Arachne
  expanded from 50,000 to 200,000; our present stock of 820,000 images
  represents an increase of around 400%. In cooperation with the German
  Archaeological Institute (DAI) in Rome, the “image_grid project” is seeking
  to solve these problems.</p>

  <p>With the “image_grid project” we have automatically contextualised about
  400,000 images from the photo library of the DAI Rome. Since its founding in
  1928, the photo library of the DAI Rome has become one of the world ́s most
  im- portant archives for archaeological imagery and many scientists from all
  over the world visit it, in order to study these images.</p>

  <p>The images were digitized using old microfche-slides and the only
  information was a printed index. We have created a digital image database
  using OCR, in order to take the structure of this index and by using the
  negative numbers of the images. We have also linked images automatically with
  complex metadata, which are derived from digitized inventories, scientifc
  reference works, images, which are now already stored in Arachne and other
  sources. Negative numbers are also used to connect images with OCR-texts (as
  in the iDAI.Bookbrowser or GoogleBooks), and by extracting knowledge from
  these books via text-mining we can connect new metadata to these digital
  images.</p>
