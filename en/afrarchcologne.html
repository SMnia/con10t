            <p>For over fifty years, archaeological research in Africa has been done at
                the Institute of Prehistoric Archaeology at the University of Cologne. In
                addition to the rock art research started in Namibia in 1963, Northeastern
                Africa established itself as a second focus region in the early 1980s -
                both areas that had been largely "terra incognita" of prehistoric research
                until then. The focus of the various projects (including the DFG projects

            <p>The long tradition of Cologne Africa research manifests itself not only
                in manifold / a large number of publications but also in an extensive
                collection of finds, slides, drawings and texts. These are located in the

            <p>Since 2012, the African Archaeology Archive Cologne (AAArC) has made it
                its mission to digitize the archives and documentation available there and
                make it available in the object database <a href=

                Meanwhile,
                large parts of the inventories have already been digitized and are
                available online, the deeper exploration and contextualization of the
                objects represented in ARACHNE is expected in the course of the coming
                years.</p>
