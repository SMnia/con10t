  <p>For over fifty years, archaeological research in Africa has been done at
  the Institute of Prehistoric Archaeology at the University of Cologne. In
  addition to the rock art research started in Namibia in 1963, Northeastern
  Africa established itself as a second focus region in the early 1980s - both
  areas that had been largely "terra incognita" of prehistoric research until
  then. The focus of the various projects (including the DFG projects <a href=

  target="_blank">Rock Art in the higher Brandberg</a>, <a href=

  "_blank">SFB 389 ACACIA</a>) in addition to the rock art was especially on
  human-environment relationships.</p>

  <p>The long tradition of Cologne Africa research manifests itself not only in
  manifold / a large number of publications but also in an extensive collection
  of finds, slides, drawings and texts. These are located in the <a href=
  "http://www.fstafrika.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/" target=
  "_blank">Forschungsstelle Afrika</a> which has existed since 1986 at the
  Institute of Prehistoric Archaeology of the University of Cologne.</p>

  <p>Since 2012, the African Archaeology Archive Cologne (AAArC) has made it
  its mission to digitize the archives and documentation available there and
  make it available in the object database <a href=
  "http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/" target="_blank">ARACHNE</a>. Meanwhile, large
  parts of the inventories have already been digitized and are available
  online, the deeper exploration and contextualization of the objects
  represented in ARACHNE is expected in the course of the coming years.</p>
