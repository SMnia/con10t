    <p>The volumes of the series called "Palilia" existing since 1997 by the
    Rome Department of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) are not only
    impressive on account of their excellent readability but also their handy
    size. In order to guarantee this continuously and to allow the publication
    of works based on extensive documentation of archaeological material at the
    same time, CoDArchLab and the DAI Rome are treading a new path of
    archaeological publication: Supplementation of printed works by digital
    provision of additional materials using the adapted book structure. The
    volumes of the Palilia-serie themselves are independent and completely
    comprehensible in their reasoning. At the same time they are also readable
    and manageable. Readers who want to see details of the material are invited
    to take a look at the catalogues of each volume available in Arachne. On
    this page you get to the individual supplements of the Palilia-volumes.</p>
