  <p>The project is completed.</p>

  <p>The aim of the project funded by the DFG was the conservation and
  scientific development of the sculpture negatives of the DAI Rome via the
  ARACHNE database.</p>

  <p>As a result, the material has been made available for researchers
  worldwide and free of charge during the years 2004 and 2005 via ARACHNE. This
  means a significant quantitative and qualitative improvement of the material
  basis for studies on ancient scultpure. In addition to the worldwide
  provision of images, the corresponding monuments/objects have been processed
  for complex scientific issues under many combinable criteria.</p>

  <p>The material comprises key complexes of Roman sculptures from Italy. In
  addition to statues and portraits all monuments richly adorned with images
  were recorded, for example the Arch of Titus or the Arch of Constantine as
  well as the Trajan's Column.</p>
