    <h1>Arachne-Usage increased by 80 % in 2011</h1>

    <p>In our attempts to use Google Analytics according to the rules of
    <a href=
    "http://www.datenschutzbeauftragter-info.de/fachbeitraege/google-analytics-datenschutzkonform-einsetzen">
    German Data Protection Laws</a> we started to analyze Arachnes usage in
    2011. The first results for 2011 show that there has been a dramatic
    increase of traffic, that hopefully will be the base of ongoing and
    deepening research - under the strict application of data-anomymization. So
    on this page there will be an ongoing increase of analyzed aspects. We want
    to get closer to the essence of what happens in places like Arachne, to be
    able to better support it. Based on the amount of traffic and diversity,
    the Arachne-traffic can become an exemplaric case for understanding the use
    of webressources like these.</p>

    <p>IAfter the increased usage of Arachne in the year 2009, 2010 was a year
    of consolidation. We wrongly expected 2011 to be not much different, until
    we saw the numbers. The 82.000 visits (complete database sessions) from
    2010 went up to 140.000 visits in 2011, which is an enhancement of around
    73%.</p><a href="./arachneusage2011_imgusage2011.png" target=

    <h2>A Detailed View</h2>

    <p>IIn a detailed analysis of the user statistics, we can monitor
    increasing numbers in different fields.</p>I

    <h3>Unique Visitors</h3><a href=

    "_blank"><img src="./arachneusage2011_imgusage2011_uniquevisitors.png"
    width="700"></a>

    <p>IThe number of 37.857 unique visitors in the year 2010 up to 70.528
    visitors in 2011 which is an increase of 87 %. The main reason seems to be
    the introduction of the english userinterface, that triggered a lot of
    additional traffic from many places, as can be seen below. The stronger,
    but still increasable integration with Wikipedia shows some specific
    effects, too.</p>I
