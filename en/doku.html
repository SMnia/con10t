            <p>The field „Meta search (Search in all categories)“ should always be used
                first. In about 70% of all cases the amount of results may be diffuse, but it
                also contains the designated information. One can enter everything from the
                negative numbers of pictures to the inventory numbers of objects. In the
                majority of all cases further knowledge about Arachne is not required.</p>
            <h4>How is Arachne structured?</h4>
            <p>Arachne is divided into a „Structured Object-World“ and the „Unstructured
                Holdings“. In the „Structured Object-World“ the text and photo information is
                assigned to an object in the real world (1 object dataset : n images). This
                requires a major effort of indexing and structuring that can only be
                partially accomplished considering the flood of constantly produced digital
                images. Therefore Arachne contains an area which is only visible in a search
                under „Unstructured Holdings“. Here every picture is treated as one record
                and there is no overlying hierarchical level (1 dataset : 1 image).</p>
            <h4>Why does the „Structured Object World“ have such strange categories?</h4>
            <p>In the object-world of Arachne, objects of the real world are appointed
                certain categories. These categories are displayed in the search bar and are
                explained in the help text on the right side of the screen when swiped with
                the mouse. They are not always congruent with conventional material types. In
                fact, their defininition has to be understood in a greater context. For
                example, topographical units are the broadest context category in Arachne. In
                the next lower hierarchical unit certain buildings can be found. These in
                turn contain parts of the building and therein again individual structural
                elements or decorative elements like sculpture etc. These can be viewed in
                Arachne as single objects. In addition it can include sub-categories such as
                terra cotta, sculpture or capitals. Single objects are the smallest
                imaginable category in Arachne's context model. According to that, the
                control hierarchy of categories in Arachne is based on the paradigm of the
                context, which is central for the semantic web but also pertaining to
                Archaeology.</p>
            <h4>Which information is required for a picture order?</h4>
            <p>Since several images can be assigned to a single record at the same time,
                not only the serial number but also the negative number of the image is
                required. The scans can be distinguished by their signature, which usually
                contain the name of the photographer and the negative number (e.g. Malter
                Mal1100-08). The signature also shows if the Research Archive holds the
                rights to the picture (these are usually only images, whose negative numbers
                begin with the abbreviations „FA“, FA-S“, „Fitt“, „Mal“ or „Kae“) and can
                give you the license to publish it. The fastest way to identify the
                designated image for placing an order is to change to the image record by
                clicking on the negative number in the record view. Here the image can be
                positively identified by the file name which consists of the negative number
                and the serial number.</p>
