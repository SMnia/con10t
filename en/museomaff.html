  <p><strong>with texts from Dr. Annamaria Pastorino, in cooperation with

  <p><strong>MUSEO LAPIDARIO MAFFEIANO di Verona</strong></p>

  <p><strong>funded by the Fritz-Thyssen-Foundation</strong></p>

  <p>The Museo Maffeiano, named after its initiator Scipione Maffei, was opened
  in Verona in the year of 1744 as a public museum which was now not
  exclusively meant for the noble circle anymore. Scipione Maffei mainly
  collected epigraphic monuments, that were displayed in porticos around a
  courtyard. Since many monuments are connected to reliefs, it so happens that
  Maffei created an extensive collection of ancient sculpture. Maffei published
  a book illustrating and describing the various monuments in his collection,
  which is well suited for database-supported online-facsimile-edition. This
  online-edition does not represent a mere graphical rendition but aims to
  reflect a scientifically based preparation of the state of research. Clicking
  onto objects on the virtual facsimile interface activates database-access to
  the scientific information on each sculpture. This allows the attribution of
  the constantly developing state of research to the precise object in the
  Museo Maffeiano. Additionaly, a dense modern photographic documention of the
  sculptures illustrated in Maffeis work is to be created. Thus, trough the
  combination of database technology and graphical facsimile interface, a
  broader use of Maffeis work is being striven. In a time of declining library
  budgets, this offers the possibility of a free worldwide access to the rare
  engravings.</p>

  <p>The realization of this project would not have been possible without the
  help of several institutions. Sincere thanks are given to all. The generous
  funding of the Fritz-Thyssen-Foundation enables the product, the
  online-edition of the Museo Maffeiano, to be accessed publicly for free. The
  CoDArchLab of the University of Cologne along with its Faculty of Philosophy
  has also significantly contributed to the project. The programming was
  conducted by Jochen Honds, Falk Adolphs as well as Florian Willems, who was
  also responsible for the coordination of the project and the editorial
  supervision. Advice concerning photography and technical support were
  rendered by Volker Theuss. The index was created by Alexandra Busch. Thanks
  also to Dr. Margeritha Bolla from the Museo Lapidario Maffeiano di Verona,
  whose cooperation was essential for the realization of the project.</p>
