        <p>Arachne is intended to provide archaeologists and Classicists with a free
            internet research tool for quickly searching hundreds of thousands of records
            on objects and their attributes. This combines an ongoing process of
            digitizing traditional documentation (stored on media which are both
            threatened by decay and largely unexplored) with the production of new
            digital object and graphic data. Wherever possible, Arachne follows a
            paradigma of highly structurized object-metadata which is mapped onto the
            CIDOC-CRM, to adress machine-readable metadata strategies of the Semantic
            Web. This »structured world« of Arachne requires high efforts in time and
            money and therefore is only possible for privileged areas of data. While on
            the ever-increasing range of new, digital born data in reality only a small
            effort-per-object ratio can be applied. It therefore requires a
            “low-threshold” processing structure which is located in the »unstructured
            world« of Arachne. All digital (graphic and textual) information is secure on
            a Tivoli Storage System (featuring long-term multiple redundandancy) and
            distributed online through the Storage Area Network in Cologne via AFS.</p>
