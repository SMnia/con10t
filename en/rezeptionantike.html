        <p>The aim of the project is the reconstruction and online publication of
            about 1700 prints, which appeared between 1500 and 1900. In a next step
            forms of semantic networks are to be approached in separate subprojects.
            This is to be illustrated through the direct contextualisation of objects
            from Philipp von Stosch's Gem Collection.</p>
        <p>The aim of the project "Reception of Antiquity in a Semantic Network"
            within the Arachne database is the development and provision of web-based
            prints from the period between 1500 and 1830. The project’s basis is defined
            by engravings to classical, Near Eastern and Egyptian Archaeology of the
            16th till the 19th century from the library of the Rome Department of the
            DAI. These early prints (e.g. travel, research and excavation reports,
            catalogs) have been published in the examination of the excavations and
            discoveries of ancient cultures in the Mediterranean region.</p>
        <p>A total of 2,300 engravings will be processed. Of these 1,200 (status
            of July 2013) are digitized in a way, that they are available as searchable
            full text (OCR). In addition, the in the engraving presented objects are
            contextualized. This primarily concerns the structural metadata of the
            prints as tables of contents, the presence of images or captions, but also
            bibliographic data of the book. These are structured in collaboration with
            the DAI’s ZENON database by using the TEI editor which was developed for
            this purpose by the CoDArchLab. That is the technical book division into
            cover, title page, table of contents, table etc. which is tagged by using
            the TEI editor’s user interface, so links are created in a standardized
            way.</p>
        <p>Among the semantic metadata the objects pictured and described in the
            prints, and also its places and people are primarily relevant. This information
            will be identified and linked to the corresponding information in the image
            and object database Arachne, i.e. on the one hand to "real" objects and
            also to the relevant collection, topography and reception records. If this
            information is not yet available in Arachne, the corresponding records
            are created.</p>
        <p>Looking up the Stoss'schen gem collection you find the contextualizing
            of the semantic metadata deepened. The digitized titles will also be found
            on the Metasearch of the Virtual Library "PropylaeumSEARCH2".</p>
        <p>The four and a half year project "Reception of Antiquity in a Semantic
            Network" began in September 2009 and is funded by the DFG. The following
            institutions are involved: Rome Departement of the DAI, the head office
            of the DAI in Berlin, the CoDArchLab in Cologne, ZENON database and the
            Winckelmann-Gesellschaft Stendal.</p>
        <p>The expected findings of the overall project concerning former storage
            places, collection history and publication of archaeological history until
            the end of the 19th century will offer many insights to the prospective
            research into the change of the antiques understanding during the Baroque,
            Enlightenment and Classicism. Thus, the project provides insights into
            the history of archeology, in the reception of antiquity of various epochs,
            in the history of various collections and the development of archaeological
            publications. Ultimately, the project contributes to the interdisciplinary
            and cultural historical research.</p>
