  <p>After a three-million-Euro restoration, the Pergamon Altar is now in
  better condition than it has been since its discovery. Its appearance was
  impacted early on by modern additions, and obscured by decades of
  accumulating dust. Now, however, the surface can be seen afresh, impressive
  time and again to interested museum visitors and specialists alike. For this
  reason the frieze was documented photographically in multiple stages, first
  in overall views and again in detailed views of the heads. Priority was
  placed on making these images available for teaching and research, granting
  the monument an accessibility commensurate with its new condition: therefore
  an image browser was created with the support of the Fritz Thyssen Stiftung,
  continuing the concept of the very popular Ara Pacis Browser in the ARACHNE
  database.</p>

  <p>The Pergamon Altar belongs to a small group of outstanding monuments of
  classical archaeology which are of primary importance for understanding and
  studying the Hellenistic era. Through this building the Attalids demonstrated
  and justified their rule over western Asia Minor, purporting to introduce and
  protect culture as well as to keep peace – expressed through the
  representation in high relief of the Olympian gods defeating the Giants. Over
  180 figures occupy the frieze: not only the Olympians, but also the most
  obscure and rarely depicted mythological characters are assembled with
  unusual completeness. Although many of these figures had no firm
  iconographical tradition, many of the rules of ancient iconography do not
  apply in any case. This leads to a semantic “grey area” surrounding the gods
  and Giants, raising hermeneutic difficulties in identifying quite which ones
  are portrayed. This contrast between comprehensiveness and ambiguity is
  framed by an overarching categorization according to both subject matter and
  cosmic order. By contrast, the smaller and more intimately situated Telephos
  Frieze takes a well-known starting point: the foundation myth of Greek
  Pergamon. Here the Pergamene rulers show their sovereign dealings with
  imported Greek culture in a variety of ways, including several early examples
  of classicism and musealization. The Pergamon Altar is also then a milestone
  in the history of ancient artistic styles, particularly considering the
  uneven preservation of Hellenistic monuments; among other things, it is
  essential to arguments ascribing certain aspects of late Republican and early
  Imperial art to Pergamene origins. Such a point of reference among the many
  expired centers of Hellenistic art, however, also harbors the very real
  danger of overemphasis – a discussion that occasionally continues in the form
  of the Pergamene sculptor Phyromachos.</p>

  <p>These issues, central to research on the Pergamon Altar, must be evaluated
  from a functional, iconographical, and stylistic perspective, especially in
  relation to the new condition of the frieze after its comprehensive
  restoration (1994-2004). Equally important is to make these topics more
  widely known. To this end an updated image browser has been instated by the
  Archaeological Institute in Cologne (Prof. Dr. D. Boschung, Prof. Dr. R.
  Förtsch) and the Antiquities Collections of the State Museums of Berlin
  (Prof. Dr. Andreas Scholl) in connection with The Berlin Sculpture Network
  (Das Berliner Skulpturennetzwerk). This browser subsumes the photographs of
  the frieze in its new condition and combines them with textual
  annotations.</p>
