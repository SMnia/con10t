		<p>Trajan’s Column is one of the most important monuments of ancient art history. By using a dedicated image browser, it can now be researched in detail. Trajan’s Column is also contextualized to the entire contents of the Arachne. In total three intensive photo campaigns by the DAI, and the plaster cast (which is located in the Museo Civiltà), are documented here.</p>
