  <h1>Central object-database of the Research Archive for Ancient Sculpture
  at the University of Cologne and the German Archaeological Institute
  (DAI)</h1>
  
  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachne_(Archaeological_Database)"
  target="_blank">Arachne</a> is the central object-database of the German
  Archaeological Institute (DAI). In 2004 the DAI and the Research Archive for
  Ancient Sculpture at the University of Cologne (FA) joined the effort to
  support Arachne as a tool for free internet-based research.</p>

  <h2>Definition</h2>

  <p>Arachne's database design uses a model that builds on one of the most
  basic assumptions one can make about archaeology, classical archaeology or
  art history: all activities in these areas can most generally be described as
  contextualizing objects. Arachne tries to avoid the basic mistakes of earlier
  databases, which limited their object modeling to specific project-oriented
  aspects, thus creating separated containers of only a small number of
  objects. All objects inside Arachne share a general part of their object
  model, to which a more class-specific part is added that describes the
  specialised properties of a category of material like architecture or
  topography. Seen on the level of the general part, a powerful pool of
  material can be used for general information retrieval, whereas on the level
  of categories and properties, very specific structures can be displayed.</p>

  <h2>History</h2>

  <p>The ancient sculptures database was originally started in 1995 using
  FileMaker, and has been supported since 2001 from the established chair for
  Humanities Computing at Cologne university. It is also used by students
  undertaking development projects.</p>

  <p>Thanks to significant and ongoing support by the Deutsche
  Forschungsgemeinschaft since 2001, Arachne started to integrate negative
  archives of ancient sculpture that went beyond the specialised documentation
  retained in Cologne itself: the Malter- and Fittschen Archives, and since
  2003 the negatives of ancient sculpture of the German Archaeological
  Institute in Rome. All that totaled in 40.000 high quality scans of ancient
  sculptures, that are presented with a state-of-the-art scientific
  documentation. Started in 2006, the digitalization of historic glass plate
  negative collections resulted - until August 2009 - in another 65.654 digital
  images, beginning with those of the German Archaeological Institutes in
  Athens, Cairo and Istanbul. Beside this larger projects lots of activities
  are going on on different levels, for example the online preparations for the
  »Corpus der Antiken Sarkophagreliefs«.</p>

  <p>In 2004 Arachne has been reworked from the bottom structurally as well as
  editorially. After that it has been rebuilt from scratch using an MAMP
  environment. Being strategically positioned as a central object-database for
  a large federal institution which possesses about two millions of images
  inside their photographic archives and produces even more data each year in
  the course of its research activities, Arachne's potential is not too modest.
  To meet it, there is still a long way to go.</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>

  <p>Starting from week 38 of 2009, Arachne has about 3936 registered users who
  can access 503.580 scans and about 250.000 objects free of charge. Quality of
  data differs regarding the state of documentation and has to be improved in
  the areas where just a basic description took place. Forecasting the target
  area in quantities one could refer to statistical estimations of huge
  digitization-projects of Cultural Heritage in Europe. They foresee being able
  to digitize approximately 30 % of the existing material in the given
  financial circumstances. That would lead in the region of 700.000 digital
  images from archive material. With addition of newly produced documentation,
  one could hope for 1 million 20 or 30 years from now. All objects should then
  reflect their contextualisations in basic categories of material and
  topography. All categories of material cultural heritage from classical
  antiquity as well as from Asia and South America should then be integrated.
  Regarding interoperability, different steps have been taken to ensure the
  widest possible use and visibility of data, while on the other hand
  fulfilling the liabilities of intellectual property rights-management and
  copyright-protection, that DAI and FA took when documenting in the framework
  of collections, museums, excavations etc. Technical aspects of
  interoperability do address the way data is shared and connected inside the
  DAI itself, mainly between Arachne and several GIS who are being used on DAI
  excavations and surveys - so a given object will only reside once inside the
  overall dataspace of DAI, minimizing redundancy. In that sense DAI will
  support uniform resource identifiers (URI) in the near future, to
  unmistakable identify objects residing in Arachne. It is the policy of DAI
  and FA to implement the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model, for which different
  projects [1] and proposals are ongoing. Newly implemented is the support for
  the Open Archives Initiative. As a partner of CLAROSnet Arachne is committed
  to work on the issues mentioned above as well as to build a multilingual
  interface, that it lacks until today. Since April 2009 Arachne is i18n-ready,
  so the technical framework for internationalization has been implemented.
  After the necessary translation-work Arachne will have an English, Italian
  and Russian Graphical user interface (GUI) in 2010. It was the policy of DAI
  and FA to address issues of that complexity not on their own but in an
  international framework. A solution must be found for this in the near
  future.</p>

  <p>Another section of Arachne is providing ancient books with no Intellectual
  Property rights on them; here Arachne is at 300 volumes with more than 60.000
  pages, for which annotations can be made. This project is called the
  iDAI.Bookbrowser. The digitized Archaeological literature will also be
  integrated into the thematic portal of Propylaeum. In the long run a linking
  between the objects in those volumes and the objects in the databases is
  planned. This has been done in an exemplary way with Scipione Maffei's book
  about the Museo Maffeiano from 1749 and Clarac's Musée de Sculpture antique
  et moderne from 1828 onwards.</p>

  <p>Another part of the iDAIbookbrowser is a project called "Comprehending the
  ancient world with a semantic network" Stichwerkprojekt in coorparation of
  the DAI Rome and the FA. In this project engraved prints so called Stichwerke
  of ancient sites, buildings, sculptures and other archaeological artifacts
  are digitized and linked to the relevant records of the “real“ objects in
  Arachne.</p>

  <p>Emagines is a project, funded since 2006 by the German Research Foundation
  (DFG), for digitizing the large and partially very old collections of images
  held by the German Archaeological Institute (DAI).</p>

  <p>The „Berlin Sculpture-Network“ is a cooperative project between the
  Antiquities Collection of the Berlin State Museums and the Institute of
  Classical Archaeology at the Free University of Berlin.</p>
