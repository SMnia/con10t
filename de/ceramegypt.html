            <p>Pottery from archaeological excavations and surveys is fundamental in understanding the chronology of archaeological sites and the functional aspects of their contexts. Furthermore, it can serve as an important material basis for the investigation of aspects of cultural (e. g. daily life, questions of identity) and economic history (e. g. production, trade).</p>
			<p>The aspect of pottery as a trade commodity constitutes the center of interest of the multi-disciplinary CeramEgypt project. For this, French and German researchers from the Centre d’Études Alexandrines and the Archeological Institute of Cologne– sponsored by the ANR and the DFG – came together to investigate possible scenarios of local, regional and super-regional commercial activities in Hellenistic and Imperial Roman Egypt by re-investigating pottery as the richest and most extensive archaeological material available. In their inquiries, CeramEgypt will be supported by various Egyptian researchers and international projects in Egypt.</p>

			<h3>Collecting information on Egyptian-produced pottery</h3>
			<p>CeramEgypt is accumulating information regarding the pottery from various sites in Egypt. Highest priority are given to verified places of pottery production. The collected information comprise of technical drawings, a detailed and systematic fabric description and photographic documentation (ceramic objects and – if possible – their fabrics). Representative individuals of recognized fabric groups will be analyzed with at least the project's portable XRF and, if possible, also by thin section analysis (see below).</p>

			<h3>Database</h3>
			<p>The projects database is the focal point of the CeramEgypt project, as it collects, channels and presents the multi-levelled results. For this, Arachne as an established and free-to-use database for the presentation of archaeological objects has been choosen as a platform. In addition, CeramEgypt was able to build up on the results of its preceding project, CeramAlex (2011-2014), whose database will be slightly adjusted. The objective is to create an interface that not only works as a research tool for people interested in Egyptian pottery from Greek and Roman times, but also as a “catalog” to present the various information gathered over the course of the project. </p>

			<h3>Chemical and petrographic analysis</h3>
			<p>Of crucial importance to the project is the incorporation of natural scientific methods. This will enable us to better separate production sites and their eventual sub-fabrics (e. g. fine wares, cooking wares, transport containers). Such separations used to be problematic, especially on a macroscopic level, for the alluvial clays of the Nile valley and the delta.</p>
			<p>This task is on the one hand supported by the collected fabric descriptions and pictures. On the other hand, the project is provided with two portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer (Thermo Scientific's NITON XL3t) that can systematically be employed at the visited sites. This allows fordestruction free and quick on-site chemical analyzes of the studied objects. Results can also be immediately processed, therefore enabling the team to adjust the analytical program as they go along. To better distinguish the ceramic production groups, this “chemical fingerprinting” will be combined with selected thin-section analyzes, as often as this is possible.</p>
