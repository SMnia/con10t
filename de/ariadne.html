                ARIADNE brings together and integrates existing archaeological research data infrastructures so that
                researchers can use the various distributed datasets and new and powerful technologies as an integral
                component of the archaeological research methodology. There is now a large availability of
                archaeological digital datasets that, together, span different periods, domains and regions; more are
                continuously
                created as a result of the increasing use of IT. These are the accumulated outcome of the research of
                individuals, teams and institutions, but form a vast and fragmented corpus and their potential has been
                constrained
                by difficult access and non-homogenous perspectives. Arachne data has been mapped to the ARIADNE Catalog
                Data Model and published as part of the online
                catalog; Arachne, iDAI.gazetteer and iDAI.vocab have been extended and are made available to the
                European archaeological community as part of the ARIADNE services.
                <a href="http://www.dainst.org">DAI</a> IT played a leading role for the development of the Portal
                application thereby implementing new ways for visualizing geographic and temporal aggregations.

                ARIADNE will enable trans-national access of researchers to data centres, tools and guidance, and the
                creation of new Web-based services based on common interfaces to data repositories, availability of
                reference datasets and usage of innovative technologies. It will stimulate new research avenues in the
                field
                of archaeology, relying on the comparison, re-use and integration into current research of the outcomes
                of
                past and on-going field and laboratory activity. Such data are scattered amongst diverse collections,
                datasets, unpublished fieldwork reports (grey literature), and in publications. The latter still being
                the
                main source of knowledge sharing. Ariadne will contribute to the creation of a new community of
                researchers
                ready to exploit the contribution of Information Technology and to incorporate it in the body of
                established
                archaeological research methodology.
                To achieve this result the project will perform case-studies on deep integration of heterogeneous
                archaeological data sources by using Semantic Technologies and the CIDOC-CRM and use a number of
                integrating technologies that build on common
                features of the currently available datasets, and on integrating actions that will build a vibrant
                community of use.
